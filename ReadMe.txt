Computer Vision Labs in C++

This repository contains the labs that I completed for the Computer Vision course in C++. 
The labs cover a range of topics in computer vision, including image formation and geometry, 
image filtering and feature detection, image segmentation, object recognition, and deep learning for computer vision.

Each lab is provided in the form of a C++ source code file, which includes instructions for completing the lab and a set of starter code. 
The labs are implemented using popular computer vision libraries such as OpenCV.
