 Original Image
 
Gray image + max filter 5x5
Applied 5x5 max filter to remove electric cables. In that part I tried several combina8ons of min-max filters however, since our image is in gray scale and cables are darker than the pixels around the cables, I decided to con8nue with max filter. However, it highlights the salt noise and removes the paper noise. I would try also min filter which removes salt noise, but it would highlight pepper noise. In this part I tried to implement min-max filter both via using minMaxLoc func8on to put moving window(kernel) to the image and the one that I created manually. In the manual op8on I also tried to padding in order not to lose informa8on on the very end edges of window.
Gray image + 5x5 max filter + median filter 5x5
In the image I saw salt noise and tried to reduce it with medianBlur filter. However, it aEer 5x5 kernel I realized that image started to blur much therefore I stopped there.
  
Gray image + 5x5 max filter + median filter 5x5 + gaussian filter 5x5
Salt noise is a different type of noise that affects individual pixels, causing them to appear as either white or black dots. Gaussian filters may not be as effec8ve at removing salt noise as median filters, which are specifically designed to handle this type of noise. I this experiment I also realized that even if it reduced salt noise a bit, it blured the image therefore I did not con8nue with that filter.
Before histogram equaliza?on
AAer histogram equaliza?on
In this part I tried to get histogram image and original (gray scaled) images both before and aEer histogram equaliza8on. AEer equaliza8on (as expected) image lightened due to more uniform distribu8on of pixel depths. In this I considered second histogram as bins and tried to draw a line like above. But aEer a period of 8me (and many tries) I realized that it is not bins but line.
